# As we need Authentication in almost all our apps hence created this boilerplate code which you can pull and start your express project

# I have committed the configs folder but in real world app you should have it in .gitignore

# I am using an MLAB instance for my mongodb database but you can substitute it with any connection of your choice by substituting the values in mongodb-config.js

# if you face any issues or can improve this boilerplate then please lemme know

# take care and happy coding ya'll
